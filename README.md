# BadgerTPLL

Mainly used for builders on Build The Earth servers. It allows users to automatically have their computer clean the data being copied into their clipboard, so that one can copy coordinates from almost any format, and it will be reformatted to be compatible with any Build The Earth server. Additionally, it also adds on the /tpll command at the beginning of the clipboard entry so that manual pasting is quicker. Lastly, it also automatically opens up Minecraft and teleports you to the coordinates that the user has copied.
